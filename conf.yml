# Copy over or symlink these repositories
# Note: the 'placed' field means where is the actual folder (src) for the symlink
# The location is relative to the location of the conf.yml (this file)
# Recommendation:
# Clone your dotfiles via the subrepos category
# Then symlink the required folder into your home folder
# This way, all your dotfiles stay in one place
